                <h2>Our Project</h2>
                <p class="justify">
					We are both seniors in high school at the time of writing this. We partnered up to create a senior project together, which ended up as a website for financial planning. The skills required to do this are varied. We chose this specific project because it utilizes skills we already possess while also including some that we need to learn. Our purpose was to create an open tool for anyone to use for help with planning their future, just as we are currently trying to do. One of the biggest aspects of this project was learning to collaborate and manage the files in a shared database. Neither of us had previously published a website on the internet, giving us another thing to learn. Overall, we both had a wonderful time putting this together. We even created a blog to record our journey of making it! You can check that out below! We hope that this site is helpful to you. If so, please consider sharing the site with others so we can reach as many people as possible!

						I did little bits of coding in elementary and middle school but mostly got into it in high school. I did block coding and programming in middle and elementary. In high school, I learned Python and dabbled in other languages and concepts. I have done a small amount of HTML and CSS in the past but did not make a website with it until this year. I have enjoyed it so far. I have not yet collaborated on websites, so it is a new learning experience. I have had struggles learning how to manage files with other people, but I think I’ve figured it out now. I have always enjoyed parts of finances. I also love figuring out the math portion of completing all the calculations on the website. In the end, it turned out well, in my opinion.

						I’ve been coding since middle school. I learned that I was a natural and enjoyed it immensely. Since then, I’ve learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python. I’ve also started to learn Java, Bash, PowerShell, and SQL. However, throughout most of my programming life, I have spent my time on one-person projects. Collaborating on a website is something new to me. I have learned how to use GitHub and manage a group so far, but the project is still adapting with regard to the exact method of working with another person. I recently began planning my financial future, so the idea of an all-in-one financial planning website was born. Thus, here it is! I hope this website helps you personally, and thank you very much for taking the time to check it out!
